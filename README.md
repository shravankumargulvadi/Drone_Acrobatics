# Drone Acrobatics

## Motivation

Quadrotors have gained popularity due to their high maneuverability, vertical take-off and landing capabilities, and hovering capabilities. They have many practical applications in fields such as surveillance, agriculture, and search and rescue. However, this project explores a more unconventional application of quadrotors: acrobatic flight.

Acrobatic flight is both interesting and challenging, as quadrotors are in a highly unstable state during these maneuvers. Hardware limitations and disturbances, such as wind or turbulence, also pose significant challenges. However, by exploring the limits of quadrotor flight through acrobatic maneuvers, we can potentially unlock new possibilities for control algorithms and hardware design.

## Objectives

The primary objective of this project is to perform a flipping maneuver on a Crazyflie 2.0 quadrotor. This maneuver will push the limits of the quadrotor's capabilities and allow us to explore the boundaries of acrobatic flight. By successfully performing this maneuver, we hope to demonstrate the potential of quadrotors for acrobatic applications.

## Approach

To achieve our objectives, we will follow the following approach:

### Flipping Maneuver

The flipping maneuver is a complex maneuver that involves several stages, including:

- Ascent phase: During this phase, the quadrotor ascends to a suitable altitude for performing the flip.

- Trajectory generation: A trajectory is generated for the flipping maneuver, taking into account the quadrotor's current position, orientation, and velocity.

- Flipping controller: A flipping controller is designed to execute the flipping maneuver by applying the necessary control inputs to the quadrotor.

- Stabilizing controller: After the flip, a stabilizing controller is used to stabilize the quadrotor's orientation and bring it back to a steady state.

### Workflow

The project will follow a workflow that includes the following stages:

- Modeling: A quadrotor model will be developed and used for simulation and control-based design.

- Control: A planner and flipping controller will be designed for the flipping maneuver, and a stabilizing controller will be designed for stabilizing the quadrotor after the flip.

- Hardware: The control algorithms will be integrated with the hardware, and the quadrotor will be tested in a safe environment.
